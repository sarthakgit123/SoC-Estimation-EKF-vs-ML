This project presents a comparative study of State of Charge (SoC) estimation techniques for lithium-ion batteries using two primary approaches:

Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) â€” a model-based method leveraging battery system dynamics

Machine Learning (ML) â€” data-driven models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost

The objective is to develop accurate SoC estimation models using voltage, current, and temperature inputs, and to analyze their performance using both MATLAB/Simulink and Python-based tools.

BATTERY MODELING AND DATASET DESCRIPTION
EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL(ECM)
The Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) using a 1 RC Thevenin model is a simplified and effective way to represent the dynamic behavior of a lithium-ion battery.
